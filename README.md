# Blazor BlackJack

This is the code for a basic game of BlackJack, in Blazor Server.

I built this as a prototype for a Tavern Game within Raid on the Forest of Horrors.

You can play the expanded version (With Splits, DoubleDowns, Surrenders, and Insurance) at <a href="https://MessageBase.net/ROTFOH/" target="_blank">https://MessageBase.net/ROTFOH/</a>
